# Statistical-Methods-from-DeGroot-Schervish-A-Practical-Implementation
This repo brings to life key statistical concepts from DeGroot &amp; Schervish - Probability and Statistics (2012) through Python. It bridges theory with practice. The goal is to explore probability, statistics, and data-driven decision-making with code and visualizations.

Current Progress:
âœ… Measures of Central Tendency (Mean, Median, Mode, etc.)
ðŸ”„ Measures of Dispersion (Variance, Standard Deviation) â€“ Coming Soon
ðŸ”„ Simple Linear Regression & Correlation â€“ Coming Soon
